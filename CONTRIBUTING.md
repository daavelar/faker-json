Of course, I can provide instructions in English for anyone who wants to contribute via GitHub. Here are the steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: First, you need to fork the repository. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account. You can do this by clicking on the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repository page.

2. **Clone the Repository**: After forking, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this using the `git clone` command. For example:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your_username/faker-json.git
```

3. **Create a New Branch**: Before you start making changes, it's a good practice to create a new branch. This helps keep your changes separate from others. You can create a new branch using the `git checkout -b` command. For example:

```bash
git checkout -b your_branch_name
```

4. **Make Your Changes**: Now you can start making changes to the code.

5. **Commit Your Changes**: After making your changes, you need to commit them. This records your changes in the Git history. You can do this using the `git commit` command. For example:

```bash
git commit -m "Description of changes"
```

6. **Push Your Changes**: After committing your changes, you need to push them to GitHub. You can do this using the `git push` command. For example:

```bash
git push origin your_branch_name
```

7. **Create a Pull Request**: Finally, you can go to your repository page on GitHub and click on the "New Pull Request" button. Select the branch you created and click on "Create Pull Request".

Remember to provide a detailed description of your changes when creating the pull request. This will help the project maintainers understand what you did and why.
