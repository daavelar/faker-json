# Faker Json

Faker Json is a library in PHP that uses the Faker library to generate valid JSONs from templates with variables.
The idea is to replace variables in the format `${variable}` or `method(arguments)` with values generated by the Faker library.

## Installation

```bash
composer require daavelar/faker-json
```

## Usage

```php
use Faker\Factory;
use FakerJson\FakerJson;

$faker = Factory::create();
$fakerJson = new FakerJson($faker);

$template = '{
    "name": "firstName",
    "email": "email",
    "phone": "phoneNumber",
    "age": "numberBetween(18, 65)"
    "company": {
        "name": "companyName",
        "address": "streetAddress",
        "bs": "buildingNumber"
    }
}';

$json = $fakerJson->generate($template);

echo $json;
```
